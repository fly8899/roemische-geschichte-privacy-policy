    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      In order to access my database there will be an anonymous account created for each install of the app.<br>
      I can not identify users, I can not see what they do and I don't want to.<br>
      If a user wants to read about something in detail, a connection to Wikipedia is established to load the article. <br>
      <br>
      I personally do not collect any data but the app requires the user to connect to Wikipedia and Google Firestore.  <br>
      Therefore I will link their privacy policies below. <br> 
      <br>
      Links:<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Services</a> <br>
      <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy">Wikipedia</a>
    
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope you have a great day.
